Basic example of text summarization using Python with the `gensim` library and including the removal of stop words:

```python
import gensim
from gensim.summarization import summarize
from gensim.parsing.preprocessing import remove_stopwords

# Step 1: Data Collection (Assuming you have a document for summarization)
document = """
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction 
between computers and humans using natural language. It involves the development of algorithms and models 
to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text. NLP has various applications 
such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, and speech recognition.
"""

# Step 2: Text Preprocessing
preprocessed_text = remove_stopwords(document)

# Step 3: Text Summarization
summary = summarize(preprocessed_text)

# Step 4: Output
print("Original Document:\n", document)
print("\nPreprocessed Text:\n", preprocessed_text)
print("\nSummary:\n", summary)
```

This example removes stop words using `remove_stopwords` from the `gensim` library before applying the text summarization with `summarize`.
