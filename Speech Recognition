Basic example of speech recognition using Python with the `SpeechRecognition` library:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# Step 1: Data Collection (Assuming you have an audio file for transcription)
audio_file_path = "path/to/audio/file.wav"

# Step 2: Audio Preprocessing
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Step 3: Feature Extraction
with sr.AudioFile(audio_file_path) as source:
    audio_data = recognizer.record(source)

# Step 4: Model Selection & Training (Handled by the library)

# Step 5: Recognition
try:
    text_transcription = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
    print("Transcription:\n", text_transcription)
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print(f"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {e}")
```

This example uses the `SpeechRecognition` library to transcribe speech from an audio file using the Google Web Speech API. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pip install SpeechRecognition`) and adjust the `audio_file_path` variable to the path of your audio file.
